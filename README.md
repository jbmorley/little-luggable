# Little Luggable

Raspberry Pi Portable

![Photo of the Lunchbox Luggable sitting on a desk](images/hero.jpg)

## Overview

The Little Luggable is my take on a cyberdeck. It's built around the [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) and the [Pelican 1150 Protector Case](https://www.peli.com/eu/en/product/cases/protector/1150) and is loosely based on Jay Doscher's [Metal Kit](https://doscher.com/work/metal-kit). It includes a fully-custom mechanical keyboard designed to perfectly fit the lid of the 1150.

Check out the [project page](https://jbmorley.co.uk/projects/little-luggable) on my website for more.

## Making Your Own

Little Luggable is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 and I'd love to see people take the design and make it their own. Pull requests are encouragedâ€“I'm excited to see where we can take this. Please share photos if you do make one.

Right now I have a few spare PCBs and aluminium screen mounting plates as I had to order in bulk so reach out if you'd like one at cost + shipping.

The original design was done in Fusion 360 which makes it a little hard to share, but I'm happy to figure out ways to do so if there's interest.

## Parts

Where possible, the Little Luggable uses off-the-shelf parts. I've separated these out and tried to provide links to places you can purchase standard parts. The links are currently pretty UK / US centric and I'd love pull requests for options for other markets.

## Future Ideas and Improvements

- [ ] Aluminium mounting plate
  - [ ] Check aluminium kerfing (measure the computer mounting plate)
  - [ ] Counter-sink the mounting holes
  - [ ] Check the required hole size for M2.5 screws
- [ ] Improve battery and power switch header positions
- [ ] Different facia colours
- [ ] Try 3d printing the switch collar
- [ ] Check mounting plate thickness

- Generating renders for the documentation:
  1. Render using Fusion 360 with a white, solid color background, and no ground plane
  2. Trim the resulting image using [mogrify](https://imagemagick.org/script/mogrify.php):
     ```bash
     mogrify -trim -bordercolor white -border 60 render.png
     ```
