# Little Luggable

Raspberry Pi Portable

## Overview

The Little Luggable is my take on a cyberdeck. It's built around the [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) and the [Pelican 1150 Protector Case](https://www.peli.com/eu/en/product/cases/protector/1150) and is loosely based on Jay Doscher's [Metal Kit](https://doscher.com/work/metal-kit). It includes a fully-custom mechanical keyboard designed to perfectly fit the lid of the 1150.

Check out the [project page](https://jbmorley.co.uk/projects/little-luggable) on my website for more.

## Parts

Where possible, the Little Luggable uses off-the-shelf parts. I've separated these out and tried to provide links to places you can purchase standard parts. The links are currently pretty UK / US centric and I'd love pull requests for options for other markets.

## Future

- [ ] Aluminium mounting plate
  - [ ] Check aluminium kerfing (measure the computer mounting plate)
  - [ ] Counter-sink the mounting holes
  - [ ] Check the required hole size for M2.5 screws
- [ ] Improve battery and power switch header positions
- [ ] Different facia colours
- [ ] Try 3d printing the switch collar
- [ ] Check mounting plate thickness
