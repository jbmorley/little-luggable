## Settings

Settings for the [Makespace](https://makespace.org) laser cutters[^laser]:

[^laser]: These are for my own personal reference; you'll almost certainly want to do a few test cuts with your own laser cutter to dial in the correct settings.

- Jaws
  - 3mm acrylic
    - Speed = 10
    - Power = 85
    - Corner Power = 80

  - 1.5mm acrylic
    - Speed = 10
    - Power = 55
    - Corner Power = 55

- Betsy
  - 3mm acrylic
    - Speed = 10
    - Power = 90
    - Corner Power = 85

  - 1.5mm acrylic
    - Speed = 10
    - Power = 55
    - Corner Power = 55

N.B. When cutting 1.5mm acrylic, the kerfing seems to be about ~0.1mm so dimensions need to be adjusted for high-tolerance parts like the keyboard mounting plate. For example, I found I needed to adjust the 14mm key-switch cutouts to be **13.8mm** to ensure the switches clip securely in place.
